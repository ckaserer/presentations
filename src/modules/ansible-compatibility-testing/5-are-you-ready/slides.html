        <h2>Python 2 is officially End of Life...</h2>
        <aside class="notes">
            Your Python 2 applications will keep running past Jan 1, 2020 – they won’t self destruct – but they will become less reliable and more vulnerable over time as bugs, security issues and CVEs crop up. Some things to think about:

            There will be no official support forthcoming for the Python 2 interpreter or the Python 2 standard libraries from the Python 2 core team. Additionally, there are no guarantees that the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) or the Python Package Index (PyPI) will continue to support Python 2 for any length of time past the EOL date.
            Community developers working on Python 2 and Python 3 versions of their packages will deprioritize working on their Python 2 code. In fact, many authors have indicated that all work on their popular Python 2 packages will be dropped in 2020 in favor of Python 3 development only.
            Vendors that offer Python 2 distributions today (such as Linux vendors, Docker, cloud providers, etc) will likely phase out their support for Python 2 over time. While Python 2 offerings are unlikely to disappear from their catalog on January 1, 2020, the scope of their support may become limited over time.
