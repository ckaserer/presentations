        <h2>Fundamental Orchestration Takeaways</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Distributed Application Architecture orchestrates one or more containers across one or more nodes</li>
            <li>Orchestrators abstract away the differences between processes and between nodes</li>
            <li>Orchestrators enhance scalability and stability</li>
        </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>We started out this workshop wanting to run any app, anywhere, because process migration is so integral to modern enterprise computing.</li>
                <li>By exploring the concequences of that idea, we came up with this notion of distributed application engineering, that underwrites things like microservices and devops, while enhancing portability, density and security of our apps.</li>
                <li>But when we started thinking in terms of orchestrated containers, we realized the added power and opportunity of shifting our thinking away from individual processes on individual machines, towards understanding our applications as scalable groups of processes (services) and scalable groups of nodes (swarms).</li>
                <li>The portability of containers allows us to schedule tasks in a way that erases the difference between machines in our datacenters, and the immutability and rapid deployment of containers allowed us to create the abstraction of services that are intrinsically more scalable and more robust than any individual process could ever be.</li>
            </ul>
